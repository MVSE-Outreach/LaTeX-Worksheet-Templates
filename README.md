# LaTeX Worksheet Templates

Contains LaTeX templates and examples for creating worksheets for MVSE Outreach and Digimakers workshops.

## Why?

The University of Bristol's MVSE Outreach programme has lots of worksheets - a rapidly growing number - in a huge variety of styles and formats. It'd be great to have them in one consistent style using LaTeX so we can:

* Easily update styling across all worksheets
* Easily publish to multiple formats (e.g. pdf, web, other stuff we might think of)

Consistent styling also helps you guys - the people running and helping with the workshops! Especially at events like Digimakers with the drop-in area and being placed on workshops last minute. If all the worksheets are in the same style/layout/format then we'll be able to pick up and start teaching with new worksheets much faster. We're also planning on increasing the amount of training for session helpers (especially for going into primary schools) so again, consistent styling will help.

## How?

LaTeX is actually really simply to set up and use (for these worksheets at least). I've tried really hard to wrap all the complexity up in nice, simple commands. It should only take you about 15 or 20 mins to get set up and using the generic template.

1. Download and install the basic(/recommended) version of [MiKTeX : http://miktex.org/](http://miktex.org/)
2. (Windows) Download and install [TEXnicCenter : http://www.texniccenter.org/download/](http://www.texniccenter.org/download/)
3. (Linux) Download and install [TeXMaker : http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or try `sudo apt-get install texmaker`
4. Open the editor, allow it to use MiKTeX if it asks
5. Create a new project in a folder
6. Download a copy of the /Template/ folder in this repository!
7. Copy all the contents of that folder into your project
8. Open GenericTemplate.texmaker
9. Copy the contents of that file to your project's main file
10. Read the comments in the template to learn how to use it
11. Woohoo! Time to start writing your own worksheet!

(And yes, I did consider writing a worksheet for this how-to guide, but it didn't seem worth it.)

## What about existing worksheets?

You have a choice, either:

* Be very kind and convert your worksheet to the new format or,
* Send your worksheet to Ed Nutting (e.g. submit it via an Issue on this repo) and he will attempt to convert it for you.
** Please include raw images and any other original material whenever possible.

## Modifying the template

For the LaTeX-loving brave souls among you, you can help improve the template. However, we ask that you submit pull requests for changes and don't, really please don't, modify the setup or title page for just your worksheets - this is all about consistency people!

## Where to submit my worksheet?

To the repository associated with your project OR, if there is no such repo, to this repository using a Pull Request (or create an Issue and Ed Nutting or someone else will help you out).
