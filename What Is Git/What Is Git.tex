    \item This workshop is intended to last 1 hour.
        
    \item This workshop is intended for people with no prior knowledge of Git, GitHub or GitKraken. You don't need to be able to use the command line for this tutorial (or to use Git!).
    
    \item This workshop aims to teach the skills needed for working on small Outreach projects (i.e. other workshops). As such, we will ignore many of the feature of Git that you would need in industry. This is a good starting point though.
    
    \item The content is intended to be learnt through self-directed individual learning by following the worksheet and practicing actions repeatedly until you remember how to do them. 

    \item The learning platform is Git for Windows or Linux and GitHub. For both platforms, we will use the GitKraken user interface (sorry, but command line people can probably already figure out how to use Git on their own).
    
    \item This workshop probably works on Mac but is untested (unless anyone fancies donating a Mac to me? :) \#worthatry )
    
    \item There are many of versions of Git, all of which should be compatible with this workshop (but might not be - if you follow this guide, you'll end up with the right one installed.)

    \item You should already be comfortable using your platform of choice including: installing programs, opening programs, managing files and folders, signing up for stuff via email and accessing the internet (which is presumably how you got this worksheet in the first place?)

    \item This workshop teaches the following skills:
    \itemlist {
        \item Creating an account and repository on Github
        \item Cloning a new/empty repository
        \item Configuring a new/empty repository
        \item Installing a git client
        \item Configuring a git client
        \item Adding (/creating) files inside your project
        \item Pushing and pulling files
        \item Viewing the commit history
        \item Correcting a mistake in a file
        \item Discarding some or all changes to a file
        \item Viewing, creating and commenting-on issues on GitHub

\section{Introduction}

Hi! In this short workshop we're going to try to introduce you to Git - industry's (pretty-much) standard tool for version control and what we use in the MVSE Outreach programme for managing files. Don't worry if you have no idea what \enquote{Version Control} is just yet - we're going to start from the ground up.

% Leave this here on all worksheets, please stick to the format - the aim is for consistency not lots of special fancy stuff on every sheet (though odd bits of fancy stuff is cool).
Let's get started. Each section is made up of four parts:
