    \item This workshop is intended to last 1 to 1\( \frac{1}{2} \) hours.
    
    \item The workshops are intended for ages 9\textsuperscript{+} (years 5\textsuperscript{+}).

    \item The content is intended to be learnt through supervised individual work, using the worksheet as guide.

    \item The learning platform is the Drawdio electronics kit, as developed by Adafruit.

    \item Students do not need to have used the kit before.
		
		\item Students do not need to have used wires, wire cutters or practiced soldering before. We will supply the required tools and materials and teach them how to use them safely.
		
    \item This document includes some notes about what you need to do to prepare for us to come and run the workshop.

\section{Guide}

The following notes are guidelines for the things we have thought of or know from experience need to be prepared before we arrive to run the workshop. Please use these notes as an addition to any guidelines and preparation you would normally follow.

\valuelist{6cm}{    
    \item [Provision of equipment] If you do not wish to buy Drawdio kits for your group, please let us know in advance. We are able to provide kits in order to run the session. If we provide kits, we will need to allow at least an additional 10 minutes for handing them out.
    
    \item [Risk Assessment] This workshop involves soldering which means hot equipment is around. This does pose a risk to children if they are careless or left unattended. We do our best to minimise this risk, including teaching children how to use the equipment safely while still having fun. All our volunteers will have been trained in advance to spot potential risks and prevent injuries. Please remember to include low risk of hand burns on your risk assessment. 
        
    \item [Website Access] Please ensure your IT administrator has unblocked the Arduino website and our Github site: https://github.com/MVSE-Outreach/ The easiest way to test this is to get a student (not a teacher) to open the websites and attemtp to browse them. 
        
    \item [Students with special needs] We are happy to accommodate students who have special educational needs or disabilities. If you can, please make us aware of any students in the group who might need extra attention and any additional information that will help us make the workshop as enjoyable and successful as possible for them.
    
    \item [DBS Checks] Your school or organisation may require valid DBS checks (previously called CRB checks) for our volunteers. Please let us know if this is the case so we complete the process. All of our volunteers are current members of the University of Bristol.
    
    \item [Name List and Contact Information] We would very much like to be able to keep in touch with students to encourage them to attend our other free, open outreach events (such as Digimakers). If possible, please supply us with a list of the names of students and their parent's contact information so that we may follow up with them after the last workshop. We never send spam and we'll only contact parents to let them know about our other outreach events that are available to them.
