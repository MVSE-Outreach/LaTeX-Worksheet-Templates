\section{Introduction}

Hi! In this short workshop we're going to continue from the previous workshop to see how you might extend your locked corridor, and to build a cool-looking machine.

In the previous workshop we helped you along with screenshots and information. In this workshop we're going to follow two videos.

\subsection{Single-entry room}

For this section, we'd like you to follow along with the video to build a room that only one person can enter at once.

\href{https://youtu.be/wxFaW0UcTGI}{YouTube: Building a single-entry room : https://youtu.be/wxFaW0UcTGI}

Once you've finished building the room, see if you can add locks to it on either side using the circuit from Minecraft Redstone Part 1.

\subsection{Minecart Wave Machine}

The Minecraft community has a wide range of videos about how to build things. For this section, we'd like to you to follow along with another member of the community to build a Minecart Wave Machine.

\href{https://youtu.be/-AodAy8sPSk}{YouTube: Making a Minecart Wave Machine : https://youtu.be/-AodAy8sPSk}

\subsection{Challenges}

See if you can build a Minecart Wave Machine inside a single-entry, code-locked room where the wave activates when you enter the room!

See if you can extend the Minecart Wave Machine design so that the Minecarts are always stopped in the right place, even if a player switches on and off the switch very quickly.
