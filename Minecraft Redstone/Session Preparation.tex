    \item Each of the two workshops is intended to last 1 to 1\( \frac{1}{2} \) hours.
    
    \item The workshops are intended for ages 9\textsuperscript{+} (years 5\textsuperscript{+}).

    \item The content is intended to be learnt through self-directed individual or pair game play, using the worksheets as guides.

    \item The learning platform is Minecraft, the popular block-based building game.

    \item There are a number of versions of the Minecraft game, not all of which are compatible with these workshops:
    \valuelist{7cm}{ 
    	\item [Minecraft for Windows or Mac] This version {\bfseries is compatible}.\par {\footnotesize This is the normal version downloadable from the Minecraft website.}
    	\item [Minecraft for RaspberryPi] This version {\bfseries is not compatible}.\par {\footnotesize This version does not include the required Redstone features.}
    	\item [Minecraft Education Edition] This version {\bfseries is compatible}.\par {\footnotesize You may wish to set this up with your class before we arrive to run the workshop.}
    }

    \item Students should already be comfortable playing Minecraft.\par This means they should be able to move easily, place and destroy blocks, use items, access the inventory (in Creative mode) and be familiar with the various block types available in the game.
    
    \item This document includes some notes about what you need to do to prepare for us to come and run the workshop.

\section{Guide}

The following notes are guidelines for the things we have thought of or know from experience need to be prepared before we arrive to run the workshop. Please use these notes as an addition to any guidelines and preparation you would normally follow.

\valuelist{6cm}{
    \item [Logging on] If you have enough PCs/Macs for the whole group, please ensure the children are logged on before we begin the session.
    
    \item [Provision of laptops] If you do not have enough PCs/Macs for the whole group, please let us know in advance. We may be able to provide laptops in order to run the session. If we provide laptops, we will need to allow at least an additional 15 minutes for handing them out and logging everybody on / getting set up.
    
    \item [Game Installation] Please ensure the Minecraft game is installed on the computers you intend the group to work on during the session. You may need to talk to your IT administrator to get them to install it and unblock the Minecraft login server. Minecraft Education Edition is currently free for any UK educational institution including primary and secondary schools. We highly recommend you get your IT administrator to configure and install Minecraft Education Edition.
    
    \item [Network Access] Please ensure your IT administrator has unblocked any restrictions that might prevent children from logging into the game. The easiest way to test this is to get a student (not a teacher) to open the game launcher and attemt to log in. 
    
    \item [Accounts] Please ensure every student participating in the session has a Minecraft account. Unfortunately, we cannot provide funding to pay for accounts - this will need to come from parents or the school itself. Minecraft Education Edition is currently free for any UK educational institution including primary and secondary schools. We highly recommend you get your IT administrator to configure and install Minecraft Education Edition.
    
    \item [Data Privacy] (Ignore this note if you are using Minecraft Education Edition). Please be aware that standard Minecraft logins are hosted on servers typcially residing in the USA. You will need to check with parents and students that they are aware their data may be tramsferred outside the UK and EU and that they are happy for this to occur.
    
    \item [Students with special needs] We are happy to accomodate students who have special needs. If you can, please make us aware of any students in the group who might need extra attention and any additional information that will help us make the workshop as enjoyable and successful as possible for them.
    
    \item [DBS Checks] Your school or organisation may require valid DBS checks (previously called CRB checks) for our volunteers. Please let us know if this is the case so we complete the process. All of our volunteers are current members of the University of Bristol.
    
    \item [Game Familiarity] As per the workshop description, please ensure all students attending the workshop are confident in playing the game. Please see Workshop Summary Notes for the list of requirements for confident gameplay.
    
    \item [Name List and Contact Information] We would very much like to be able to keep in touch with students to encourage them to attend our other free, open outreach events (such as Digimakers). If possible, please supply us with a list of the names of students and their parent's contact information so that we may follow up with them after the last workshop. We never send spam and we'll only contact parents to let them know about our other outreach events that are available to them.
