\section{Introduction}

\questions{
    \item What kind of block is the Redstone ready world made from?
    
    \answer{Sandstone}
    \item How many blocks vertically downwards are there till you reach the bedrock?
    
    \answer{55 (may vary if inside certain structures)}
}





\section{Placing and Powering Redstone}

\subsection{Boosting power}

\questions {
    \item Which side of a repeater accepts power in?
    
    \answer{Side with the slot / slider.}
    
    \item Which side of a repeater outputs power?
    
    \answer{Side with the fixed-position stick.}
    
    \item How far (counted in blocks) does power travel out of a repeater?
    
    \answer{16}
}



\section{Redstone Torches}

\subsection{Torch on a block}

\questions {
    \item What would happen if you powered a block using a wire from a torch placed on the same block?
    
    \answer{Feedback loop causing rapid on/off switching. Eventually the torch burns out i.e. stops working.}
    
    \item When you power on the wire, is there a delay before the torch on the block switches off?
    
    \answer{Yes - 1 tick}
}

\subsection{NOT and NOR gates}

\questions {
    \item What happens when you power the input of the first NOT gate?
    
    \answer{Feedback loops causes flickering. Eventually, the torch \enquote{burns out} i.e. stops working.}
    
    \item Is two NOT gates in a row like this, the same as a repeater?
    
    \answer{Yes but two tick delay not one tick and takes up more space.}
}

\questions {
    \item What combination of inputs makes the lamp switch on?
    
    \answer{All inputs must be off.}
    
    \item What combinations of inputs makes the lamp switch off?
    
    \answer{One or more inputs being on.}
    
    \item If you wire all three inputs together, then put them into the block, is it the same thing? 
    
    \answer{Yes. Wire together is an OR gate. The block and torch forms a NOT gate. Combined as OR followed by NOT, they make a NOR gate.}
}

\questions {
    \item What is the output of a NOT gate if its input is on?
    
    \answer{Off.}
    
    \item What is the output of a NOR gate, if it has three inputs of which two are on and one is off?
    
    \answer{Off.}
}


\section{Using NOR gates}

\subsection{AND gates}

\questions {
    \item Which inputs to an AND gate have to be on to make the output (i.e. the lamp) switch on?
    
    \answer{Both inputs must be on.}
    
    \item Which inputs to an AND gate can be off to make the output (i.e. the lamp) switch off?
    
    \answer{Either or both can be off.}
}

\subsection{Locked doors}

\questions {
    \item What is the delay between switching the levers and the door opening and closing?
    
    \answer{(May depend on what circuit they've actually built). For the intended circuit: Min=5 ticks, Max=6 ticks}
    
    \item Can you work out what is causing this delay?
    
    \answer{Delay is caused by torches on blocks i.e. the NOT/NOR gates and the door has a 1 tick switching delay}
    
    \item Here's a tricky one for you: Can you make the circuit smaller?
    
    \answer{Yes. Can be compacted to one NOT gate per \enquote{on} lever and one combining NOR gate (no need for repeater). Can be made either 3 blocks wide, 1 high or 3 blocks high and 1 wide.}
    
    \item Lastly: Does making the circuit smaller reduce the open/close delay?
    
    \answer{Yes. Min=1 gate between levers and door=2 tick delay, Max=2 gates between levers and door=3 tick delay - twice as fast!}
}
