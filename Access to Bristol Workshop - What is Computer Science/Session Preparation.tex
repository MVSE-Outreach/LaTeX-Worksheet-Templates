    \item Students should already be comfortable with the idea of coding.\par This might be from a computing course at school or just self taught. They won't have used this language before but the worksheet tells them all they need to know.

\section{Guide}

The following notes are guidelines for the things we have thought of or know from experience need to be prepared before we arrive to run the workshop. Please use these notes as an addition to any guidelines and preparation you would normally follow.

\valuelist{6cm}{
    \item [Logging on] If you have enough PCs/Macs for the whole group, please ensure the students can log on.
        
    \item [Software Installation] No additional software is required for this workshop - just a web browser!
    
    \item [Website Access] Please ensure your IT administrator has unblocked our Github site: https://github.com/MVSE-Outreach/ The easiest way to test this is to get a student (not a teacher) to open the websites and attemtp to browse them. 
        
    \item [DBS Checks] Your school or organisation may require valid DBS checks (previously called CRB checks) for our volunteers. Please let us know if this is the case so we complete the process. All of our volunteers are current members of the University of Bristol.
    
    \item [Name List and Contact Information] We would very much like to be able to keep in touch with students to encourage them to attend our other free, open outreach events (such as Digimakers). If possible, please supply us with a list of the names of students and their parent's contact information so that we may follow up with them after the last workshop. We never send spam and we'll only contact parents to let them know about our other outreach events that are available to them.
